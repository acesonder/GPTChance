----- START OF SURVEY #1****
Here are five ‚Äútriage‚Äù questions you could ask every new respondent to steer them toward the single most relevant survey first. After each question I‚Äôve sketched out how the answer would point you at one of the ten:
	1.	What‚Äôs your most urgent need right now?
	‚Ä¢	‚òê Finding or stabilizing housing ‚Üí Housing Trajectory & Support Needs (Survey 6)
	‚Ä¢	‚òê Managing health, medications, or mental-health crises ‚Üí Physical & Mental Health Snapshot (Survey 3) or Rapid Health & Safety Pulse (Survey 10)
	‚Ä¢	‚òê Addressing substance use or overdose risk ‚Üí Substance Use Patterns & Self-Perception (Survey 4) or Harm Reduction & Overdose Risk (Survey 5)
	‚Ä¢	‚òê Building connections or contributing to community ‚Üí Community Connection & Resilience (Survey 8)
	‚Ä¢	‚òê I‚Äôm not sure‚ÄîI just want an overall picture ‚Üí Demographic & Social Determinants Profile (Survey 1)
	2.	Are you currently without stable shelter or facing eviction?
	‚Ä¢	Yes ‚Üí Basic Needs & Capability Assessment (Survey 2) or Housing Trajectory & Support Needs (Survey 6)
	‚Ä¢	No ‚Üí skip straight to health, substance, or community questions
	3.	In the past month, have you missed doses of prescribed medication or gone without food you‚Äôre able to eat safely?
	‚Ä¢	Yes, regularly ‚Üí Basic Needs & Capability Assessment (Survey 2) or Rapid Health & Safety Pulse (Survey 10)
	‚Ä¢	No ‚Üí move on to substance-use or community connection
	4.	Do you consider your substance use to be a problem right now?
	‚Ä¢	Yes ‚Üí Substance Use Patterns & Self-Perception (Survey 4)
	‚Ä¢	I use but it‚Äôs not a problem ‚Üí maybe Community Connection & Resilience (8) or Demographic Profile (1)
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm not sure ‚Üí Harm Reduction & Overdose Risk (Survey 5)
	5.	Would you like to tell us about your strengths, talents, or ways you already help other people?
	‚Ä¢	Yes, definitely ‚Üí Community Connection & Resilience (Survey 8)
	‚Ä¢	Not really ‚Üí pick a more needs-focused survey (1‚Äì6 or 9‚Äì10)

‚∏ª


----- END OF SURVEY #1****
How it works:
	‚Ä¢	Q1 is your master switch‚Äîif someone has a glaring immediate need, you send them to that domain‚Äôs deep dive.
	‚Ä¢	Q2 and Q3 further disambiguate between housing versus health/basic-needs urgency.
	‚Ä¢	Q4 routes folks into the right substance-use survey based on self-perceived severity.
	‚Ä¢	Q5 catches those who are in a more ‚Äúasset-oriented‚Äù mindset and primes them for the resilience/community survey.

With these five questions, you‚Äôll quickly assign each person to the single survey most likely to capture the information you need first.




----SMART SURVEY #1---------
Triage Intake (5 Questions)
	‚Ä¢	A brief set of adaptive ‚Äúgateway‚Äù questions determines a respondent‚Äôs top priority (housing, health, substance use, community engagement, or general assessment).

HERE ARE THE 10 SUVEYS  

Survey 1: Demographic & Social Determinants Profile
	1.	What is your age?
	2.	What gender do you identify with?
	3.	What is your racial or ethnic background?
	4.	How long have you been living in Cobourg?
	5.	What is your employment status?
	6.	What is your current source of income?
	7.	What is your highest level of education?
	8.	Do you currently have a government-issued ID, health card, or driver‚Äôs license?
	9.	What job or life skills would you like to share?
	10.	Would you like help connecting to services (mental health, housing, employment)?

Importance & Hypotheses
These core questions establish each respondent‚Äôs social position and human capital. By mapping age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, and documentation status against expressed skill-sets and service desires, you can test hypotheses about intersectional vulnerability (e.g., younger individuals with lower education report greater service needs) and the role of social determinants of health in shaping outreach outcomes. This survey also underpins theories of structural inequality, exploring whether demographic factors systematically align with gaps in service linkage.

‚∏ª

Survey 2: Basic Needs & Capability Assessment
	1.	Do you currently have pets with you?
	2.	Where are you currently staying most nights?
	3.	How long have you been experiencing homelessness?
	4.	Do you have a government-issued ID, health card, or driver‚Äôs license?
	5.	What is your employment status?
	6.	What is your current source of income?
	7.	Are your dietary needs being met in your current living situation?
	8.	Are you able to access your prescribed medications regularly?
	9.	Do you have a family doctor or primary care provider?
	10.	What does a typical day look like for you right now?

Importance & Hypotheses
This set zeroes in on the Fulfillment of basic needs‚Äîfood, shelter, healthcare, and stability. It tests Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy in a lived environment, hypothesizing that those lacking ID or medical access describe more chaotic daily routines. It also examines the capability approach: whether pets (as emotional support) correlate with better self-reports of daily structure. Finally, it can uncover service gaps: for example, ‚Äúpeople without regular medication access are twice as likely to report no stable daytime routine.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Survey 3: Physical & Mental Health Snapshot
	1.	Do you have a visible or invisible disability?
	2.	Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition?
	3.	If not diagnosed, do you feel your mental health is poor or could use support?
	4.	Have you ever attempted suicide?
	5.	Have you ever experienced an overdose?
	6.	Do you have a family history of homelessness, substance use, mental health struggles, suicide, or overdose?
	7.	Do you take any prescribed medications?
	8.	Are you able to access your medications regularly?
	9.	What support would you need to be able to move forward or improve your situation?
	10.	How do you feel the community views people experiencing homelessness?

Importance & Hypotheses
By combining objective diagnoses with self-perceptions and crisis histories, this survey explores the biopsychosocial model of health. You can test whether those with invisible disabilities or family histories report poorer access to care, and whether perceived stigma (‚Äúcommunity views‚Äù) mediates help-seeking. Hypotheses include: ‚ÄúParticipants with prior suicide attempts will more often cite lack of medication access as the primary barrier to recovery,‚Äù illustrating the interplay of structural factors and trauma.

‚∏ª

Survey 4: Substance Use Patterns & Self-Perception
	1.	Do you currently use any substances (alcohol, tobacco, or drugs)?
	2.	Which substances do you use?
	3.	How often do you use substances?
	4.	Do you feel that you have an addiction?
	5.	If yes, would you describe your addiction as substance-related, behavioural, or both?
	6.	Have you ever been through a treatment or rehab program?
	7.	If yes, how would you rate your experience?
	8.	Did you experience substance use in your household as a child or youth?
	9.	Did you experience mental illness in your household as a child or youth?
	10.	What community supports or services do you access for substance use or harm reduction?

Importance & Hypotheses
This battery tracks both current behaviour and intergenerational context, key to social learning theory of addiction. It will allow you to test whether childhood exposure predicts self-perceived addiction severity or treatment uptake, and how prior rehab experiences shape ongoing harm-reduction engagement. You might find, for instance, that ‚Äúthose who rate their treatment experience poorly are twice as likely to report daily use,‚Äù suggesting gaps in program efficacy.

‚∏ª

Survey 5: Harm Reduction & Overdose Risk
	1.	Do you use harm-reduction supplies (clean needles, pipes, naloxone)?
	2.	Would you use a supervised safe-consumption site if it were available?
	3.	Have you ever experienced an overdose?
	4.	Have you ever attempted suicide?
	5.	Do you have a family history of substance use or overdose?
	6.	Have you ever been through a treatment or rehab program?
	7.	If yes, how would you rate your experience?
	8.	Do you feel you have an addiction?
	9.	How often do you use substances?
	10.	What do you think could help you move forward or improve your situation regarding harm reduction?

Importance & Hypotheses
Focusing on proximal risk and protective factors, this survey tests the risk environment framework. You can examine whether willingness to use a supervised site correlates with prior overdose, or if family history amplifies perceived need for naloxone. Hypotheses include: ‚ÄúFrequent users with past overdoses will express higher willingness to adopt supervised-use services,‚Äù revealing readiness for targeted interventions.

‚∏ª

Survey 6: Housing Trajectory & Support Needs
	1.	Where are you currently staying most nights?
	2.	How did you become homeless?
	3.	How long have you been experiencing homelessness?
	4.	Do you currently have pets with you?
	5.	Do you have a government-issued ID, health card, or driver‚Äôs license?
	6.	What is your employment status?
	7.	What is your current source of income?
	8.	What community supports or services do you access?
	9.	What isn‚Äôt working or could be improved in your shelter or housing supports?
	10.	Would you like help connecting to services such as housing, employment, or medical care?

Importance & Hypotheses
This trace of the housing journey tests the Housing First model, asking whether immediate support needs (ID, income) align with shelter satisfaction and openness to referrals. You can test if those with pets report fewer viable shelter options, or if length of homelessness predicts lower trust in community supports. Example hypothesis: ‚ÄúClients homeless over six months are 50% more likely to request ID-support services.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Survey 7: Shelter & Service Satisfaction
	1.	What is working well for you in the shelter or housing supports you‚Äôre using?
	2.	What isn‚Äôt working or could be improved?
	3.	Are your dietary needs being met in your current living situation?
	4.	Are you able to access your prescribed medications regularly?
	5.	Do you have a family doctor or primary care provider?
	6.	What strengths do you have that others in the community could benefit from?
	7.	Would you like help connecting to services such as housing, employment, or medical care?
	8.	How do you feel the community views people experiencing homelessness?
	9.	What does a typical day look like for you right now?
	10.	What support would you need to be able to move forward or improve your situation?

Importance & Hypotheses
By soliciting both praise and critique of existing services, this survey evaluates client-centered care and service quality theory. It will surface actionable feedback (e.g., food vs. medical access) and test if more positive service experiences correlate with greater self-reported strengths and community engagement. One might hypothesize: ‚ÄúParticipants reporting good medication access also report more daily structure and express higher confidence in contributing to community.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Survey 8: Community Connection & Resilience
	1.	What do you value most about being part of a community?
	2.	When have you felt most connected or helpful to others?
	3.	What strengths do you have that others in the community could benefit from?
	4.	What community supports or services do you access?
	5.	Would you like help connecting to services such as mental health, housing, or employment?
	6.	How do you feel the community views people experiencing homelessness?
	7.	How would you like others in the community to see you?
	8.	Are there things you‚Äôd like to see change in your community‚Äîand could you play a role?
	9.	What small things could you do to help make your neighbourhood feel safer or more welcoming?
	10.	Are there community activities or groups you‚Äôd be interested in being part of?

Importance & Hypotheses
This resilience-focused survey tests social capital and empowerment theory. It reveals whether those who feel valued by their community also have stronger coping resources. You can investigate if expressed personal strengths predict willingness to volunteer or propose community improvements‚Äîhypothesizing, for example, that ‚Äúparticipants who identify their strengths are 30% more likely to express interest in local groups.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Survey 9: Rapid Demographic & Vulnerability Screen
	1.	What is your age?
	2.	What gender do you identify with?
	3.	How long have you been living in Cobourg?
	4.	What is your employment status?
	5.	What is your current source of income?
	6.	Do you have a government-issued ID, health card, or driver‚Äôs license?
	7.	What is your highest level of education?
	8.	Do you have a visible or invisible disability?
	9.	Do you currently use any substances (alcohol, tobacco, or drugs)?
	10.	Where are you currently staying most nights?

Importance & Hypotheses
As a five-minute ‚Äúpulse‚Äù screen, this battery rapidly flags key vulnerability axes‚Äîeconomic, educational, health, and housing. It allows you to test quick triage hypotheses, such as whether younger residents without ID disproportionately report substance use and unstable housing. This underpins predictive modeling: a machine-learning hypothesis might be ‚Äúthese eight variables predict high support need with 80% accuracy.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Survey 10: Rapid Health & Safety Pulse
	1.	Do you have a visible or invisible disability?
	2.	Do you take any prescribed medications?
	3.	Are you able to access your medications regularly?
	4.	Do you have any dietary needs (allergies, restrictions, etc.)?
	5.	Are your dietary needs being met?
	6.	Do you have a family doctor or primary care provider?
	7.	Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition?
	8.	Have you ever attempted suicide?
	9.	Have you experienced an overdose?
	10.	Would you use a supervised safe-consumption site if it were available?

Importance & Hypotheses
This health-safety ‚Äúpulse‚Äù focuses on immediate risks and access barriers. It tests the hypothesis that medical and dietary insecurity correlate with crisis histories (overdose, suicide attempts). For instance, you may find that ‚Äúthose lacking dietary support are twice as likely to express no regular primary-care access,‚Äù highlighting clusters of unmet needs that can inform rapid outreach strategies.

‚∏ª

Each of these ten surveys offers a focused lens‚Äîdemographic, health, substance use, housing, community resilience, or rapid triage. Together, they enable you to uncover structural patterns, test theories of social determinants, empowerment, and risk, and ultimately design interventions grounded in Cobourg‚Äôs unique lived realities.



 Here are the Title and Hypothesis   put  each one on a single page,  and call it our ideas and thoughts  
	1.	Title: Demographic & Social Determinants Profile
Importance & Hypothesis:
This survey establishes each respondent‚Äôs social position‚Äîage, gender, ethnicity, education, income, and documentation status‚Äîwhile capturing self-identified skills and service desires. It‚Äôs essential for mapping how intersecting demographic factors predict gaps in service linkage and community engagement. We hypothesize that younger participants with lower educational attainment and unstable income will report the highest unmet service needs, demonstrating a clear link between social determinants and vulnerability.
	2.	Title: Basic Needs & Capability Assessment
Importance & Hypothesis:
By focusing on shelter stability, healthcare access, nutrition, and daily routines, this survey measures the fulfillment of Maslow‚Äôs foundational needs in a real-world context. It will reveal which material and logistical barriers most disrupt daily life. We hypothesize that individuals lacking government ID or regular medication access will describe significantly more chaotic and unstructured daily routines, underscoring how basic-needs deficits undermine capacity for self-sufficiency.
	3.	Title: Physical & Mental Health Snapshot
Importance & Hypothesis:
Integrating objective diagnoses, self-perceived mental health, and crisis histories, this survey probes the biopsychosocial dimensions of well-being. It‚Äôs vital for identifying clusters of trauma, stigma, and care barriers. We hypothesize that participants with invisible disabilities or prior suicide attempts will report both lower medication access and higher perceived community stigma, confirming that structural and psychosocial factors compound one another.
	4.	Title: Substance Use Patterns & Self-Perception
Importance & Hypothesis:
Tracking current substance use, self-identified addiction, and intergenerational exposure, this instrument tests social learning theories of addiction. It‚Äôs critical for understanding how household histories shape present behavior and treatment engagement. We hypothesize that childhood exposure to substance use predicts higher self-rated addiction severity and lower satisfaction with past treatment, signaling the need for family-informed outreach strategies.
	5.	Title: Harm Reduction & Overdose Risk
Importance & Hypothesis:
Focusing on harm-reduction behaviors, overdose history, and service readiness, this survey assesses proximal risk and protective factors in the substance-use environment. It will uncover readiness for supervised-consumption interventions. We hypothesize that individuals with prior overdoses will exhibit greater willingness to use safe-consumption sites and naloxone kits, indicating a critical window for targeted harm-reduction outreach.
	6.	Title: Housing Trajectory & Support Needs
Importance & Hypothesis:
Charting how participants became homeless, their shelter experiences, and support networks, this survey evaluates Housing First principles in practice. It‚Äôs essential for pinpointing which systemic barriers (e.g., pet policies, ID requirements) prolong instability. We hypothesize that those homeless for over six months will more frequently request ID-support services and report lower trust in existing housing programs, suggesting areas for policy adjustment.
	7.	Title: Shelter & Service Satisfaction
Importance & Hypothesis:
By directly soliciting feedback on what‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs failing within shelter and housing supports, this tool measures client-centered care effectiveness. It‚Äôs crucial for continuous quality improvement. We hypothesize that participants who rate medication access highly will also report stronger daily structure and greater confidence in contributing to community, illustrating the link between service quality and personal agency.
	8.	Title: Community Connection & Resilience
Importance & Hypothesis:
Exploring values, personal strengths, and engagement preferences, this survey gauges social capital and empowerment within Cobourg. It‚Äôs key to designing peer-led initiatives. We hypothesize that respondents who articulate clear community strengths are significantly more likely to express interest in volunteering or local groups, demonstrating that self-identified assets drive civic participation.
	9.	Title: Rapid Demographic & Vulnerability Screen
Importance & Hypothesis:
As a five-minute pulse tool, this survey quickly identifies high-risk individuals across economic, educational, health, and housing axes. It underpins predictive modeling for triage. We hypothesize that a combination of younger age, lack of ID, substance use, and unstable housing will predict ‚Äúhigh support need‚Äù status with at least 80% accuracy, enabling rapid prioritization.
	10.	Title: Rapid Health & Safety Pulse
Importance & Hypothesis:
Concentrating on disability status, medication and dietary access, mental-health crisis history, and harm-reduction openness, this brief survey flags immediate risks. It‚Äôs critical for deploying time-sensitive interventions. We hypothesize that participants reporting dietary or medication insecurity will also report higher rates of overdose or suicide attempts, revealing clusters of acute vulnerability demanding swift outreach.
